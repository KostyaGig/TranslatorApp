When our user auth in app without translate word then we show him empty screen.
Task: after auth user in system we must make request on server by baseUrl/user/unique_key/words
WARNING: make above lines if our user has network connection otherwise we show him empty screen
because user hasn't data in local storage(room)

Resolve:
fun words() {

    if (networkConnection.isAvailable) {
        fetch all words from cloud db and save here to local storage
    } else {
       if (localStorage.isEmpty) {
            DataWords.Empty
       } else {
            DataWords.Cache(cacheWords)
       }
    }
}
